### Description

At iO we have an insatiable curiosity and what better way than to build a knowledge sharing platform to help us on our
way. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to build a new knowledge sharing platform where our iO colleagues
can keep their curiosity going. To start off, we would like to have a list of TedTalks for our pilot system. The list of
TedTalks is available as a csv file which you should import into the s

### Functional requirements

#### Backend

For the list of TedTalks we want available for our pilot, we have provided a csv with all the required data. For the
